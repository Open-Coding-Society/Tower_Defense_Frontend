<h2> User Story: Gene Editing Challenge</h2>

<p>As a precision geneticist using CRISPR tools,
I want to experiment with gene editing by modifying specific regions within a DNA sequence,
so that I can predict how each edit will affect the function of the gene.
Drawing from real CRISPR/Cas9 data on gene sequences and mutation outcomes, I'm presented with a DNA strand containing several targetable “bridges” — key sites where edits can be made.
For each bridge, I can choose different editing options, such as substitutions, insertions, or deletions.
After making my changes, machine learning models like SVM and Random Forest forecast the biological impact — including whether the edit introduces a harmful mutation, enhances gene function, or results in a neutral change.
My challenge is to optimize edits for beneficial outcomes while minimizing genetic instability. This experience helps me understand the power and complexity of gene editing, where every decision carries weight.</p>
