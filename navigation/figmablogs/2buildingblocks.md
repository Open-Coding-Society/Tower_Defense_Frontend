<h2>User Story: DNA Building Blocks</h2>

<p>As a genomics researcher-in-training,
I want to explore and manipulate DNA sequences by selecting and swapping nucleotide blocks,
so that I can understand how mutations alter genetic code and predict their biological impact.
Using real nucleotide and mutation data from the Ensembl Genome database, I interact with a DNA strand visualized on screen.
Some base pairs are highlighted or misaligned, and I must drag and place correct or alternative blocks into those positions.
Once I finalize a sequence, machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) evaluate the impact of my edits â€”
revealing whether the mutation is silent, harmful, or beneficial based on known patterns.
My goal is to build stable, functional DNA strands while learning how small changes in code can lead to big changes in biological outcomes.</p>
