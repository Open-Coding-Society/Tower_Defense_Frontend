<h2> User Story: Antibody Blackjack</h2>

<p>	As a biomedical researcher exploring immune response dynamics,
I want to strategically select and combine antibody fragments in a blackjack-style format,
so that I can optimize antigen binding while avoiding unstable or ineffective combinations.
Drawing from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), each “card” I draw represents a unique antibody fragment, with real structural and binding affinity data behind it.
My goal is to build the most stable antibody-antigen pair without “busting” — meaning exceeding the optimal stability threshold or selecting incompatible fragments.
As I build my hand, machine learning models (K-Nearest Neighbors and Neural Networks) analyze my selected fragments in real-time,
predicting binding efficacy and structural stability. If the final antibody configuration falls within the optimal range, I score high for immune precision.</p>
