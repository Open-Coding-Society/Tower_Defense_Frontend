### Ideate
The Scripps Research: Biotech Engagement Game Development project uses interactive games to introduce students to biotechnology. Each game is built around real scientific data and machine learning models, allowing players to tackle challenges like predicting disease outbreaks or designing new treatments. Through gameplay, students experience how data and AI are used in real-world research to solve major health problems.  

### What is its purpose?
This project makes biotechnology education more engaging and accessible. Many students struggle with biotech concepts through traditional learning, but this project turns them into interactive experiences. By using real-world datasets and machine learning models, players analyze data, make decisions, and see real-time outcomes. This hands-on approach builds problem-solving skills and a deeper understanding of how biotech research impacts global health. Beyond education, the project addresses real-world challenges like disease outbreaks, genetic engineering, and drug discovery. By immersing students in these scenarios, it highlights the role of biotechnology in solving critical health issues.

### Source 
The main source of the project itself is the Scripps Research Institute, however, we will be using a variety of datasets to simulate real-life conditions that prompt critical thinking skills. We will be using the adventure game from Mr. Mort's website as a base for all our work.

### **4. Antibody Blackjack**  
- **Dataset:** Protein Data Bank (PDB) – antibody-antigen interactions, binding affinity scores.  
- **ML Model:** K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks – predict binding efficacy and stability.  
- **Gameplay:** Players draw antibody fragments like blackjack; ML predicts if the binding score is optimal or unstable.

### **6. Pathogen Platformer**  
 **Gameplay:** Players run, jump, and dodge through environments infected by different pathogens. Each level represents a new infection zone. Players must:
- Collect genome fragments and sequence data
- Use a lab station checkpoint to classify the pathogen using AI (ML model)
- Choose the right treatment or containment method (quarantine, vaccine, etc.)
- Unlock the next zone if they neutralize the threat
