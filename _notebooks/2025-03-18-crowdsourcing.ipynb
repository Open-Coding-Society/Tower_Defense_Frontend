    "### **What is Crowdsourcing?**\n",
    " - Crowdsourcing is a method of collecting help, ideas, or input from a large and varied group of people, typically through online platforms. Rather than depending on just a few individuals or experts, crowdsourcing uses the shared knowledge, experiences, and skills of many people to solve problems, collect data, or generate content. This approach can help limit Computer Bias by including more diverse perspectives.\n",
    " - The broader the crowdsourcing effort, the more you go beyond your immediate circle, the better chance you have to reduce Computer Bias. Crowdsourcing allows people to share knowledge, access shared resources, and work together across different locations through distributed computing."

    " - Crowdsourcing helps create new and exciting products by bringing together ideas and resources from many people. One great example is Spotify, which uses crowdsourcing to improve music recommendations. When users make collaborative playlists, like for a party, Spotify learns about different music tastes. By looking at what people listen to and share, Spotify suggests new songs that match each person’s preferences. Users also help by sharing details about songs, and this information is checked and approved by the community.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Another example is Kickstarter, a platform that helps people fund creative ideas. Instead of depending on a few big investors, creators can share their projects with the public and get small donations from many supporters. This gives inventors the money they need to turn their ideas into real products.\n",
    "\n",
    " - In short, crowdsourcing helps drive innovation by letting people work together, share knowledge, and support projects. It allows companies and creators to develop things like personalized music suggestions and new inventions that better serve the needs of their audience."
