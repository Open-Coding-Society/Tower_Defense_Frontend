    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend is a Flask application using SQLAlchemy for ORM and modular Blueprints for each feature. The \"points\" system is a core part of the game, tracking user scores or in-game currency.\n",

    "### Points Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Stores and manages each user's points.\n",
    "- **Integration:** Imported and used in `main.py` and other modules.\n",
    "- **Database:** Each entry links a user to their points value.\n",
    "- **Backup/Restore:** Included in backup and restore operations for persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Points API\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blueprint:** Registered as `points_api` in `main.py`.\n",
    "- **Endpoints:** Provides RESTful routes to get and update user points.\n",
    "- **Usage:** Allows the frontend to fetch and modify points for gameplay, rewards, and leaderboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modular Design:** Each feature (users, points, etc.) has its own model and API.\n",
    "- **Data Management:** Points are included in backup, restore, and data extraction commands.\n",
    "- **Security:** Endpoints can be protected with authentication as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The Points API and model provide a robust, modular way to manage user scores in the tower defense game, supporting core gameplay and administrative features in the Tower Defense backend."
